Procedure LineNavigator_Bot()
1. Start
2. Initialize the Arduino board, IR sensors, SONAR sensor, and motors.
3. Continuously read inputs from the IR sensors to detect the line.
4. If the Black line is detected by the left IR sensor, adjust the bot to turn slightly left.
5. If the line is detected by the right IR sensor, adjust the bot to turn slightly right.
6. If no line is detected, stop the bot and prepare to search for the line again.
7. Simultaneously, read the distance from the SONAR sensor to check for obstacles.
8. If an obstacle is detected within a defined distance, stop the bot.
9. Execute the obstacle avoidance maneuver by turning the bot right or left to avoid the obstacle.
10. After avoiding the obstacle, return to line-following mode.
11. Repeat the process of line detection and obstacle avoidance continuously.
12. End
